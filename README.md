## Features
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and highlight specific patterns within financial PDF documents.
- **User-Driven**: Users can indicate patterns by drawing boxes around different elements in the document.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to learn and recognize patterns throughout the document.
- **Efficient Processing**: Once patterns are identified, the tool can process them across the entire document.

## How It Works
1. **Upload**: Start by uploading your financial PDF document to the tool.
2. **Pattern Indication**: Users can indicate patterns by drawing boxes around different elements such as text, tables, and data.
3. **Machine Learning**: The machine learning algorithm learns from the indicated patterns to recognize them throughout the document.
4. **Processing**: Once patterns are recognized, the tool efficiently processes them, extracting valuable data.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with Financial PDF Pattern Recognition:
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-pdf-pattern-recognition.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the Tool**: Execute `python recognize_patterns.py` and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Example Usage
```python
from financial_pdf_pattern_recognition import PDFPatternRecognizer

# Initialize the pattern recognizer
recognizer = PDFPatternRecognizer()

# Load PDF document
pdf_document = "example.pdf"
recognizer.load_document(pdf_document)

# Indicate patterns by drawing boxes
# Code to draw boxes here...

# Train the model
recognizer.train_model()

# Recognize and process patterns throughout the document
recognizer.process_patterns()
